							<h2>Make a studying routine...</h2>
							<p class="info"></p>
						</header>
						<p align="justify">You have to figure out what time of day and which days of the week are best for you and make it part of your routine. If you study at the same time, in the same place, week after week, studying will become habitual, and you’ll have a far easier time finding the motivation to do it. 
						It’s like taking a workout class. The first few times it’s difficult to motivate yourself to go. But if you go to the same class week after week, pretty soon it becomes part of your routine and you look forward to your workout.

						Your online college courses probably come with additional resources. Many schools like mine, the Holy Angely University uses online libraries
						such as Netacad and Canvas. Reading extra materials and conducting additional research will help 
						firmly establish your knowledge and prepare you for success on your future exams.

						Breaks are an important part of the studying process as well. 
						The human mind can only stay focused for so long before it starts to run out of energy. Take a five-minute break every hour. 
						Stand up, walk around the room, stretch, maybe go get some coffee or treat yourself with a snack, and come back to your desk refreshed.

							<h2>Short-term Goals</h2>
							<p class="info"></p>
						</header>
						<h3>1. Pass all the requirements on Time</h3>
						<p align="justify">
						Assignments when submitted on a timely basis have a great impact on the overall grades. 
						Managing all your work is a practice that can become habitual and is beneficial especially for you.
						</p>
						<h3>2. Making time for myslelf</h3>
						<p align="justify">
						Yes, studying and passing all the requirements is needed but never forget to make time for yourself. 
						Students tend to be stressed out when it comes to finising all the tasks due, making time for yourself brings a positive feedback 
						to you mentally and physically.
						</p>
						<h3>3. Be present at all times</h3>
						<p align="justify">
						Being on the class all the time is the right way but being present is not only on the physical aspect, you must be present mentally
						in order to learn the lesson that your professor is teaching. Make every lesson worth your time.

							<h2>Long Term Goals</h2>
							<p class="info"></p>
						</header>
						<h3>1. Focus on self improvement</h3>
						<p align="justify">
						Growth in yourself eventually leads you to new opportunities, opportunities that don't come about until you grow into 
						the person who is ready for them. From relationships to careers – knowing your strengths is important for every sphere of your life. It gives you a better 
						understanding of what you are seeking and where you are likely to thrive and excel.
						</p>
						<h3>1. Build my career</h3>
						<p align="justify">
						Being a college graduate is just a stepping stone for me. Career goals wre the hardest for
						me to come up with after college. Being unsure of what I wanted to do with my life. 
						Career aideas are not measureable, ther are dependend on our circumstances.
						</p>
						<h3>1. Just have fun</h3>
						<p align="justify">
						Having a fun life is about more than doing fun things and having adventures. 
						You need to cultivate a mindset that embraces play, pleasure, and laughter. Work on loosening up and opening yourself up to spontaneous moments. 
						Incorporate play in your day-to-day life, as play is as important in adulthood as childhood.
						</p>
