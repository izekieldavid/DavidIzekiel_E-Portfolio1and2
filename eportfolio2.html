						 The quote "Do What You Have To Do Until You Can Do What You Want To Do." simply tells us that we must endure all 
						 the things that is happening to us in our present situation until we can breathe again. We have all been there,
						 stuck doing something we would rather not do. We are doing things that we would rather not do, but the fruits of what 
						 we are doing enable us to get to where we want to go. 
						</p>
						
						<p align="justify">
						 Sometimes we just need to do what we need to do to keep business and life going. When we take care of life and take care 
						 of others as we work on what we love to do, we open up more opportunity to do what we love. In conclusion I can simply say
						 that, "Just do it."
